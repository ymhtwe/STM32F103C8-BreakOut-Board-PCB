# STM32F103C8-BreakOut-Board-PCB 

This repository contains the design files and documentation for a breakout board for the STM32F103C8 microcontroller. The PCB provides easy access to all of the microcontroller's pins and includes a 3.3V voltage regulator and USB-to-serial converter for easy programming and debugging.

Contents
Gerber/: Contains the Gerber files needed to manufacture the PCB.
Schematic/: Contains the schematic and BOM (bill of materials) for the PCB.
3D_Model/: Contains 3D models of the PCB for visualization purposes.
LICENSE: Contains the license for this repository.
How to use
To use this breakout board, you will need to manufacture the PCB using the Gerber files in the Gerber/ directory. You can then assemble the PCB using the components listed in the BOM in the Schematic/ directory.

The USB-to-serial converter on the PCB can be used to program and debug the STM32F103C8 microcontroller using a standard micro USB cable. The microcontroller can be programmed using the STM32CubeIDE or any other compatible IDE.
