# STM32F103C8-BreakOut-Board-PCB 

This repository contains the design files for a breakout board for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller in a 48-pin LQFP package. The breakout board provides easy access to all the pins of the microcontroller, as well as a USB-to-serial converter for programming and debugging.

Features
Compact breakout board for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller
All pins of the microcontroller are accessible via headers
Onboard 3.3V voltage regulator and decoupling capacitors
USB-to-serial converter for programming and debugging
Bootloader mode for easy firmware updates
Getting started
To get started with the STM32F103C8 Breakout Board PCB, you will need the following:

STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller (not included)
USB-to-serial cable (not included)
Development environment (e.g., STM32CubeIDE, Keil, or Arduino IDE)
To program and debug the microcontroller, connect the USB-to-serial cable to the J1 header on the breakout board, and connect the other end of the cable to your computer. Open your development environment and select the appropriate settings for the microcontroller and programming interface. You can then program and debug your firmware as usual.
